LISTS

    Collection of data which are normally
    related instead of stored as separate variables

        insert a new element to the list using .append()
        inserting an element at a specific position using insert()
        removing a specific element using remove()
        removing an element from the end using pop()
        len(): to find the number of items ina list
        in: it checks if an item is in a list
        combine two list using .extend()
        reverse(): reverses the item in a list
        sort(): sort items alphabetically or numerically
        concatenate a list using +
        duplictae the list and concatenete it

Tuples

    Tuples are like lists, but unlike lists we cannot modify their initial values.
    We use () when declaring a tuple
    we cannot modify it
    Tuples are immutable
    This means we can't add change or remove individual elements
    after the tuple is created
    but we can delete the whole tuple using the del keyword
        len-number of elements in tuple
        in-checks if the item is in tuple
        concatenation: addition operator
        multiplication operator:* duplicates the tuple and concatenate it.
