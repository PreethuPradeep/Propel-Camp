Introduction to Software programming

What is Computer Programming

    A process that professionals use to write code that instructs how a computer application or software program performs.
    Computer program is a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions.
    Computers understand only binary language.
    Programmers communicate with the computer using a programming language.

Common Tasks of a Computer Program
    Testing Software performance
    Resolving Computer software programs
    Modifying software programs to improve performance
    Collaborating with others to resolve confirmation technology issues
Compiler Vs Interpreter.
    Compiler
        A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code written in high level programming language into machine code,i.e, binary before the program is executed.
        The output of a compiler is usually an executable file that can be run independently of the source code.
        The compiler translates the entire program at once for faster execution after compilations. Then all errors are shown after the compilation process
        Eg. C, C++, JAVA etc.
    Interpreter
        An interpreter is a program that translates and executes source code line-by-line at runtime.
        It doesn't produce a separate executable file instead it runs the code directly
        Interpreter translates and executes the code line-by-line. It doesn't generate a separate executable file
        Slower execution since translation happens during runtime
        It stops immediately on encountering an error.
        Eg: python, JavaScript, PHPâ€¦
Algorithm
    An algorithm is a step by step analysis of the process. It is like a set of instructions to solve a problem or do something.
Flowchart
    It is the graphical representation of an algorithm with the help of different symbols, shapes, and an arrow to demonstrate a process or a program.
Variable
    It is the name we give to the memory location which holds some data. With A variable, we can store the data, access the data and also manipulate the data.
    We can also refer to variables as containers, Which stores some info or data.
    In many programming languages, while we create variables we have to give the type of data the variable holds.
    But in python,no need to specify the type, because python is a dynamically typed language.
    There is no need of specifying the data type dynamically during its creation.
    Variable names can only contain letters, numbers and underscores.
    Spaces are not allowed in variable names.
    Be careful when using the lowercase and uppercase letters because it's case sensitive.
Data Types in python
    Datatype defines the type of data stored in the memory. Python has 5 standard data types.
        Number
        String
        List
        Tupule
        Dictionary
Numbers
    Number data types store numeric values
    It is created when we assign a value to them.
    Using del, we can remove the reference to a variable.
    Python supports 3 numerical types
        Int (signed integer)
        float(floating point real values)
        Complex(complex numbers)
Python numerical type conversion
    Based on the requirement, developers can convert from one data type to another data type exclusively. This is called type conversion.
    int(x) converts x into integer
    float(x) converts x into a floating point number
    complex(x) converts x to a complex number with real part x, imaginary part 0
        Converting float into int	:int(float(X))
        Converting int to float:	float(int(x))
        Converting int to string:	str(int(x))
Arithmetic Operations in python
    Addition:	a+b
    Sunstraction:	a-b
    Multiplication:	 a*b
    Division:	a/b
    Floor division:	a//b
    Modulus:	a%b
    Exponent:		a**b
Strings in python
    A string is a series of characters
    Anything inside single or double quotes are considered string in python
