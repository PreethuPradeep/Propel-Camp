Mistakes in programs are called errors.

There are two type of errors
1. Syntax errors
2. Logical Errors

Syntax error happens when you write a code that isnt allowed in the pyython language.

Errors happens while the program is running is called exception.

Even if a statement or exception is syntactly correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it.

Errors detected during execution are called exceptions.

Try Block
Try-to run the code
except-what do if an errror happens
finally-always runs

syntax

try:
    do something
except:
    do something else when error occurs.

we can use variables to represent a string
Using f-string(f-format), python formats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value.

Place the letter f immediatly before opening the quotation marks.

first_name="Anu"
last_name="S"

my_name=f"{first_name} {last_name}"
