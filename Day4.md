Important question

1. compare lists tuples and dictionaries based on
   1. mutability
   2. syntax
   3. use case
2. when would you use a dictionary instead of a list or a tuple?

# Comparison Operators in Python

    equality
    non equality
    greater than
    less than
    Greater than or equal to
    less than or equal to

# Logical Operators

    AND - Noth conditions must be true
    OR -At least one condition must be true
    NOR -Reverses the condition that means true becomes false and vice-versa

# Expresssions

    Expresssions is a combination of operators and operands
    that is interpreted to produce some other value

# 1.Constant expressions

    These are expressions that have constant values only.

# 2.Arithmetic expressions

    An arithmetic expression is a combination of
    numeric values, operators and sometime paranthesis.

# 3.Integral expressions

    produce only integer results after all computations

# 4.Floating expressions

    produce floating point numbers as result

# 5.Relational expressions:

    Arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational operators

#6. Logical expressions:
These are kinds of expressions
that result in either True or False

# Conditional Statement

    A condition is an expression that evaluates to true or false

    An if statement is a decision making structure that conatins
    a condition and a body of statements
        if the condition is true
            the body is executed
        if the conditiion is false,
            the body is not executed

# If-else statement

    An if satement defines actions to be performed when a condition is true

    An else statement is fused with an if statement and
    contains the body of a statements that is
    executed when the if statement's condition is false

        if condition:
            body
        else:
            body

Sometimes, a complecated decision is based on more than a single condition.
#Chaining decision statements with elif allows the programmer

# to check for multiple conditions.

#An elif(short for else if) statement checks a condition

# when the prior decision satements condition is false

# An elif statement is part of a chain and must follow an if(or elif )statement.
